Woodslunch
==========

This application is used by [Woods Charter School](http://woodscharter.org) for
lunch ordering.

Some quick notes about this software:

- It is very specific to the needs of Woods
- It has been in production use since September 2011
- Over 13,000 lunch orders have been placed and served
- It's not perfect; there are some issues to address, but it has worked pretty
  well thus far

I wrote this application in my spare time to meet the volunteering requirements
for parents of Woods Charter students. Turns out I've got about ten years of my
volunteer requirements covered. :) If you have any questions please contact TJ
Stankus (tj@stank.us).

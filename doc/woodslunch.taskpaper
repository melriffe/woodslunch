Nav:
	http://www.queness.com/post/1047/easy-to-style-jquery-drop-down-menu-tutorial doesn't seem to handle submenu widths that are greater than parent menu item. So, trying this method http://www.cssnewbie.com/easy-css-dropdown-menus/ which seems a little cleaner withouth the clears and such, and more flexible. @next
Goals for next meeting:
	Have Emily and Susan request accounts
	See their account requests
	Activate their account requests
	Promote their user accounts (not actual accounts) to admin
	This will involve:
		Setup a staging environment
		Users listing (part of accounts listing)?
		...
Misc:
- Nav menu @next
	Admin
		Reports
		Menu Items
		Account Requests
- Users listing
	- Ability to make someone an admin
- Staging app for Heroku.
- Deploy and use sendgrid. What does sendgrid give us in the way of UI to resend emails, etc. @priority
- Refactor menu_items stuff so it's not it admin namespace. There are going to be a number of controllers that have actions accessible by both admins and non-admins. So, everything's not sequestered off into the admin namespace necessarily. @priority
	- Also convert menu_items listing to use .listing_item classes in _application.scss and remove the .menu_item item stuff in _admin.scss
AccountRequests:
	- Does sendgrid have a web ui that shows account activity, like when an email was last sent, etc. @q If so, then we don't need to worry about tracking when an email was last sent.
	- Once activated the account request gets destroyed.
	- Email gets sent upon successful activation. Actually, after activation, need to redirect to screen to setup password (with confirmation), then automatically log in.
	- Deny action @priority
	- Activate
		GET account_requests/activate/:token
		Matches token against account requests in the pending 
	- AccountRequest submitted for pending AccountRequest#email request displays "There is a pending account request for #{email}."
	- AccountRequest submitted for denied AccountRequest#email creates a new AccountRequest in pending state.
	- Email must be unique for pending AccountRequests.
	- State machine for AccountRequest#state: pending, approved, denied
		pending -> approved, then account gets created and AccountRequest is destroyed
		pending -> denied
		denied -> pending
		state_machine gem (from pluginaweek) is recommended
	- Email must be unique for accounts, so when 
AccountInvitation:
@maybe What if we want to track how long it's been since the last invitation email was sent. last_sent_at, send_count, etc. Unless sendgrid gives us a way to do this stuff.
Accounts/Users/Students:
	- inherited_resources, generators for accounts/users/students with nested structure, e.g., accounts/:account_id/users
	- Test scenario of adding a user to an account.
	- Payment history (a separate model most likely).
		- Admin records a payment for this account.
		- Payment model. Belongs to account with presence validation.
Orders:
	- An order must have a unique combination of student id and served_on date. In other words, there can only be one order per student per day. Enforce this in a validation. @priority
Menu Items:
	- @q Handle items on non-daily schedules?

Later:
	- Improve number of sql statements on new order form, although it looks like most of them are coming from the cache.
	- Presenter gem

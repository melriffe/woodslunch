Menu Items:
	- @q Handle items on non-daily schedules?

Accounts:
	- User requires account. @done
	- @next Think about a more elegant way to update account balance. It should be the responsibility of the account to know how to update itself, or perhaps an observer.
	- One thing that comes up is multiple users per account. If we do that then we'll need a join between student and user, probably Guardianship or something like that. I can think of a way to calculate the account balance each time, taking total of each order and subtracting all payments, but it does seem like there's a more elegant way to do that. If setting up Student/User/Guardianship. The multiple users per account also makes it impossible for the user to *always* be the ones setting up students.
		I figured out a way to do this. First, yes to the many-to-many relationship between users and students. Secondly, the initial user account can create student profiles. Then, after that, the admin has the option to associate an account invitation with an existing account. Then student relationships, etc. can be setup.
	- Seed users so that they are associated with accounts. @done
	- Balance displayed on dashboard.
	- Live update balance on order form.
	- @q Besides links to order form, account balance, link to pay, what else should go on user/parent dashboard?
	- Payment history (a separate model most likely).
		- Admin records a payment for this account.
		- Payment model. Belongs to account with presence validation.
Student Orders:
	- Fix May display issue. Probably occurs due to the first week not including any weekdays. @done
	- 
Admin:
